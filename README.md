# Actions

Use this repository as a sandbox to test and debug GitHub Actions.

## Tips

- `git commit --allow-empty --message "Empty commit"` to add a commit, even if
  no file changed
- Add `[skip ci]` to the commit message to skip workflow execution
- Workflows do not run on PR if the PR can't be merged
